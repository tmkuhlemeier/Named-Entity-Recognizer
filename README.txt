The last versions of our pickled models were trained on Tuesday - Wednesday night. We have made some improvements in the mean time to some scripts (mainly comments in BuildModels and EvaluateModels). We tried not to touch the custom_chunker and features script and hope that they remained the same since the training.
Final Grade: 10.5 out of 10 (0.5 bonus for being among the top 5 highest accuracy algorithms).
